This project aims to empower farmers with accurate information for making crop
selection decisions. By recommending crops suitable for prevailing environmental
conditions, farmers can optimize their practices and improve yields. The system
also provides market prices and approximate yields for the recommended crop,
enabling farmers to consider profitability. The crop prediction model utilizes the
Random Forest Classifier algorithm, known for its accuracy in handling complex
datasets. By training the model on historical crop data and environmental
parameters, it can learn patterns and correlations. The integration of the model into
a user-friendly web application enhances its accessibility and usability, benefiting
farmers in their decision-making proces
